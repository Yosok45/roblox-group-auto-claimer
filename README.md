# roblox-group-auto-claimer
 
# Setup
1. `pip install flask`
2. Set the contents of `cookie.txt` to your `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie
3. Launch `bot.py`
4. Set the webhook argument of your group scanner to `http://localhost:8080/webhook`

# Usage
- To visit the dashboard, go to http://localhost:8080/.
- In order for the bot to be able to join groups, it has to have tokens ready within it's queue system.
To add a new token to the queue, click `Add Token` and solve the prompted challenge. Each token will only last a couple minutes, so you'll have to repeat this process.
